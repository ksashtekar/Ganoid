To use qemu based kernel bootup method:

Installations:

1. Make sure following packages are installed -
   a. qemu
   b. qemu-kvm
   c. qemu-kvm-extras
2. If your development machine cpu supports hardware virtualization then enable it in bios -
   a. To verify this do `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -E "vmx|svm"`
   b. See if it is disabled, `dmesg | grep kvm`
   c. If step (b) suggests that virtualization is disabled then enable it in bios
3. To use grub bootloader based method use script qemu_grub.sh
4. To use mboot bootloader based method use script qemu_mboot.sh

The wrapper scripts creates disk image and copies ganoid kernel image into it and boots using qemu.
